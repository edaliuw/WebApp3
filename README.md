## Differences between WebApp2 and WebApp3

Bracket CRUD does work. Initial team and round creation also works,  

Match creation does not work at the moment, it should work by WebApp4. 

First, the controller action needs to create matches for the first round of a given tournament, then create matches for subsequent rounds. 


## Future Goals

Initial Match Creation

View pages for Team, Round, Match. 

UI overhaul during the week
